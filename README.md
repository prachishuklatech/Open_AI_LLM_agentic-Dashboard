🚀 AI-Powered Dashboard Generator

This project demonstrates an AI-driven approach to generating dynamic dashboards from structured data using Google Colab.
Instead of hardcoding chart visuals, the AI engine generates JSON configurations that can be used by frontend frameworks (like React + ECharts) to render interactive dashboards.

📌 Overview

Modern dashboards are expected to be:
✔ Dynamic
✔ Secure (no SQL or raw data exposed on frontend)
✔ Not static visuals like Matplotlib images
✔ Generated through structured outputs (JSON) rather than fixed charts

This notebook showcases the logic to:

Load structured data

Feed it into an AI agent

Produce chart configuration JSON

Prepare the output for integration with frontend dashboards

💡 Key Concepts

AI JSON Conversion: Models are used to convert raw analytics into structured JSON rather than static graphics

JSON Chart Config: Designed to work with libraries like ECharts

Security Focus: No direct database access from frontend — all data processing trained & controlled within backend/Colab

Extensible: Can be extended to multiple data sources & dashboard widgets

🛠️ Requirements

This notebook is designed to run in Google Colab — no local setup required.

If you decide to run locally:

Python 3.x

Packages: openai, pandas, json, etc.

OpenAI or other LLM API Key (set in env)

🚀 How to Run (in Colab)

Open the notebook via Colab

Ensure GPU/Runtime settings (if needed)

Set your API key in the variable section

Run all cells step by step

Review generated JSON outputs

🧪 Output Examples

Example of a chart JSON config generated by the notebook:

{
  "type": "bar",
  "data": {
    "labels": ["Issue A", "Issue B", "Issue C"],
    "datasets": [
      {
        "label": "Frequency",
        "data": [30, 45, 12]
      }
    ]
  },
  "options": {
    "title": { "text": "Issue Frequency", "display": true }
  }
}


This JSON can be directly passed into a React + ECharts component.

💡 Why This Matters

Frontend does not need to know how charts are made

AI handles knowledge extraction and JSON schema creation

This is scalable and safer than generating images or embedding machine logic on frontend

Can be extended to other domains (finance, analytics platforms, etc.)

🔒 Security Notes

✔ Only sanitized data should be passed into the AI model
✔ Do not expose raw DB credentials in frontend
✔ Prompt structure enforces JSON-only responses
✔ Designed to prevent injection or arbitrary code execution

📂 Next Steps (for integration)

You can connect this with:

Backend API (Node/Python)

MCP Server (secure data layer)

React app for real end-user dashboards

Example workflow:
PostgreSQL → MCP Server → AI Agent → ECharts JSON → React Frontend
